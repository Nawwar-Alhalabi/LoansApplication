🏦 Loan Management System – ASP.NET Core MVC
This project was developed as a technical test for a bank job interview, aiming to provide an internal tool that helps bank employees calculate and manage customer loans with ease and accuracy.

📋 Project Overview
The system allows employees to:

✅ Register a new loan for a customer (with automatic monthly payment calculation including a 20% interest).

🔍 Search and view the loan details of any existing customer.

📆 Display a detailed monthly payment schedule, including paid/unpaid status.

🔁 Link multiple loans to the same customer automatically.

💾 Store all data using SQLite (for development) and optionally switch to SQL Server.

🛠️ Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core MVC

Entity Framework Core

Bootstrap 5 (for styling & RTL Arabic support)
